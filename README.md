# Weather-forecast-EDA

Here weather dataset is a time series data with per hour information about weather conditions of a particular place.The project tells a story about the state of the atmosphere over a specific period of time by measuring several different parameters, including ***temperature, air quality, wind speed, and precipitation level***.
Using *Pandas library* we primarily read the data and then explore the dataframe using functions like **unique , null ,value_counts** etc to clean and explore the data to get useful insights and important information about the data.
